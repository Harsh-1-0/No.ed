## Project Title and Description

**No.ed**, pronounced "Node", is an innovative AI-driven career platform designed to address the challenges students and career transitioners face due to fragmented career guidance resources. It offers a seamless end-to-end solution that bridges education and employment in the technology sector.

**Problem:** "Students and career transitioners struggle with professional development due to fragmented career guidance resources. The absence of an integrated system that connects skill development with job opportunities leads to inefficient career planning and misaligned skill development, creating significant barriers to career progression in the technology sector."

**Solution:** Our AI-driven career platform uses profiles, such as resumes, to analyze skills and interests, creating personalized career roadmaps. It recommends courses, suggests projects, and matches users with internships and jobs as they complete milestones. Progress is verified through certifications, and resumes are automatically updated, offering a seamless end-to-end solution that bridges education and employment in tech.

### Why We Think This Will Work

* **Career Transitions are Common:** Approximately 30% of the total workforce will now change jobs every 12 months. (The U.S. Department of Labor)
* **Personalized Learning Drives Engagement:** 61% of professionals are considering a career change. (LinkedIn, 2023); 30% higher engagement on AI-driven platforms compared to generic ones. (Harvard Business Review, 2022)
* **Skills-Based Hiring is Rising:** 70% of employers prioritize skills over academic degrees. (IBM Skills Report, 2023)
* **Fragmented Resources are a Barrier:** Job seekers spend over 10 hours a week searching for fragmented career resources. (McKinsey, 2022)
